    Please solve this issue: {{task}}

    You can execute bash commands and edit files to implement the necessary changes.

    ## Recommended Workflow
    1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files
    2. Create a script to reproduce the issue
    3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue
    4. Verify your fix works by running your script again
    5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust

    ## Useful command examples

    ### Create a new file:

    ```bash
    cat <<'EOF' > newfile.py
    import numpy as np
    hello = "world"
    print(hello)
    EOF
    ```

    ### Edit files with sed:

    ```bash
    # Replace all occurrences
    sed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py

    # Replace only first occurrence
    sed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py

    # Replace first occurrence on line 1
    sed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py

    # Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10
    sed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py
    ```

    ### View file content:

    ```bash
    # View specific lines with numbers
    nl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'
    ```

    ### Any other command you want to run

    ```bash
    anything
    ```

    <warning>
    The output of your last command was too long.
    Please try a different command that produces less output.
    If you're looking at a file you can try use head, tail or sed to view a smaller number of lines selectively.
    If you're using grep or find and it produced too much output, you can use a more selective search pattern.
    If you really need to see something from the full command's output, you can redirect output to a file and then search in that file.
